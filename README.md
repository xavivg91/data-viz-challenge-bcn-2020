The World Data Viz Challenge 2020 Barcelona-Kobe is a competition that aims to highlight the challenges faced by smart cities, and to invite citizens to address their realities and issues. Thanks to data analysis and visualisation, participants have the opportunity to make proposals that can be useful for further public policy elaboration and improvement.

The theme of the dataviz should reflect any aspect of the reality or a problem related to the city of Barcelona in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals that are aligned with the Strategy for the promotion of the [Agenda 2030 in the city of Barcelona](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/agenda2030/es). You can check out more information about the competition [here](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/world-data-viz-challenge-bcn-kobe-2020).


In this repository you can find a Shiny application developed by [@lau-cloud](https://github.com/lau-cloud) and me. You can enjoy the final visualization [here](https://bcndata.wixsite.com/accidents2019).
